### _A General FAQ_
A game about making big numbers!  There are a variety of gameplay elements going on in this game, but this brief overview should provide some clarity. 
The current goal is to get to New Game+ by buying all abilities. [3.x]

### Panels
Swiping left will bring you to the panels screen. On this screen you can click on your panels to have them run. Each panel earns an upgradeable amount of currency per iteration. Swiping left again will allow you to upgrade these panels. Certain milestones do things like increase speed or provide substantially more currency for that panel. At the bottom of this screen you can upgrade the amount of currency you gain per tap. Automation of these panels comes semi-randomly in the form of abilities, for which you will see a pop-up.
At the top of this screen there is a button to toggle information between "per cycle" and "per second" to allow you to have a better understanding of what each panel is doing.

### Upgrades
Swiping right from the main screen brings you to the screen where you can purchase upgrades. These upgrades range from new abilities that you have to equip to base panel upgrades and more. These upgrades are purchased with credits, which are a separate currency.  Some abilities must be equipped from the ability deck in the hamburger menu at the top right of the screen.  Others (such as panel speed, panel growth etc) are automatically applied when you purchase them on this screen. 
White: Common
Green: Uncommon
Blue: Rare
Purple: Epic
Gold: Legendary
Red: Elite
Aqua: Ultimate

### Modules
Swiping right twice from the main screen will bring you to the modules page. This is a miniature merge game inside myriad. Modules provide a global profit % buff. Continue merging your modules to increase that buff. Note that there are abilities that affect the rarity of modules spawned and other factors related to the modules. 

### Refinery
Each different refinery provides a different type of buff. The first 3 refineries work with your modules, providing profit bonus, cost decrease, and speed increase to any modules selected in the 'allocated menu. Each successful run of the refinery on a particular panel will increase the amount of time required to refine it again. Note that new panels unlocked are NOT automatically allocated. The 4th and 5th refineries deal with units and credits and are explained by clicking on them. 

### Equipment

Perk Discriptions

⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ LUCK: Makes all chances better. 
Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it has diminishing returns.

⭐⬛⬛⬛⬛ BURST: Can make crits add extra taps 
It stinks. By the time you unlock BURST you are already doing 50+ TPS so an extra tap here or there doesn't make a difference.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CRIT RATE: How often taps crit
Haven't used.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CRIT MULTI: 
How big a tap crit is - Haven't used.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ TPS: 
Taps per second - Not sure if 1 level = 1 TPS? Good early game when you have low TPS.

⭐⭐⭐⬛⬛ MOD RARITY: 
Increases mod level chance - Higher mods are good. Only problem is it requires ~100 levels of this to go up 1 rarity.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ U RARITY: 
Increases Upgrade rarity - Even better then mod rarity. Still requires a lot of levels to go up one level.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CREDIT DROP: 
More credits drop - Haven't used. But guessing it doesn't increase drops by that much... Plus late game when you need credits you mostly idle so this wouldn't help.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ DUP: 
Duplicator makes mods dup. It's ok.

⭐⬛⬛⬛⬛ MERGE CHARGE: 
When you merge, the next mod spawns faster - If your really active early game then it can give you something to do. Late game you auto merge and this doesn't do anything. 

⭐⭐⭐⬛⬛ TIER MERGE: 
Chance to go up more levels when mods merge - Haven't used. If it increases the chance to merge higher by a lot then could be 4 or 5 stars.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EQUIP TIER: 
Makes equipment have a higher tier - THIS IS THE BEST. Makes all equips have higher boosts. I had around 20 levels total and it made my equips all boost by 1E27

⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ E RARITY: 
Increases equipment rarity - Really good, but like all other rarities takes tons to make a difference... 

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ U LEVEL: 
Increases Upgrade level - Don't know if this still spawns. I think 1 perk level = 1 upgrade level. Can make upgrades high level.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CHEST RARITY: 
Increases chest rarity - Chest rarity is broken right now so is actually bad. If chests were not broken would still be the worst rarity perk.

### Ability Deck
On the ability deck page you can spend your pool of AP to mix and match the abilities you would like to use. At the top of this page you have the option to purchase new equippable abilities using units. Units are a 3rd currency gained thru rebirthing. The higher you push in a run before rebirthing, the more units you get.  These units individually each provide a 1% global profit boost and also can be spent permanently for new abilities, so striking a balance between purchasing new abilities and keeping enough units for your global buff is crucial. As you purchase more copies of the same abilities, they are recorded as XP, and once enough is gained you can spend units to permanently increase that ability. 
Module tier pretty much does the same thing execpt its +1200% under the mood
