### _A General FAQ_
A game about making big numbers!  There are a variety of gameplay elements going on in this game, but this brief overview should provide some clarity. The current goal is to get to New Game+ by buying all abilities. [3.x]

# General Tabs
### Tapper Page
The main screen is a blank canvas to click on. As you continue to click you will see a multiplier that will grow and stay active as long as you continue clicking. Occasionally, you will see critical hits that provide bonus currency. This will build your basic currency. On this screen you will see pop-ups that include daily gifts, random chests, your taps per second (at the bottom) and a minimized version of your panels. At the top of this screen there is a button to toggle information between "per cycle" and "per second" to allow you to have a better understanding of what each panel is doing.

### Panels Page
Swiping left will bring you to the panels screen. On this screen you can click on your panels to have them run. Each panel earns an upgradeable amount of currency per iteration. Swiping left again will allow you to upgrade these panels. Certain milestones do things like increase speed or provide substantially more currency for that panel. At the bottom of this screen you can upgrade the amount of currency you gain per tap. Automation of these panels comes semi-randomly in the form of abilities, for which you will see a pop-up. 

### Upgrades
Swiping right from the main screen brings you to the screen where you can purchase upgrades. These upgrades range from new abilities that you have to equip to base panel upgrades and more. These upgrades are purchased with credits, which are a separate currency.  Some abilities must be equipped from the ability deck in the hamburger menu at the top right of the screen.  Others (such as panel speed, panel growth etc) are automatically applied when you purchase them on this screen. 

### Ability Deck
On the ability deck page you can spend your pool of AP to mix and match the abilities you would like to use. At the top of this page you have the option to purchase new equippable abilities using units. Units are a 3rd currency gained thru rebirthing. The higher you push in a run before rebirthing, the more units you get.  These units individually each provide a 1% global profit boost and also can be spent permanently for new abilities, so striking a balance between purchasing new abilities and keeping enough units for your global buff is crucial. As you purchase more copies of the same abilities, they are recorded as XP, and once enough is gained you can spend units to permanently increase that ability. 

### Modules
Swiping right twice from the main screen will bring you to the modules page. This is a miniature merge game inside myriad. Modules provide a global profit % buff. Continue merging your modules to increase that buff. Note that there are abilities that affect the rarity of modules spawned and other factors related to the modules. 

### Refinery
Each different refinery provides a different type of buff. The first 3 refineries work with your modules, providing profit bonus, cost decrease, and speed increase to any modules selected in the 'allocated menu. Each successful run of the refinery on a particular panel will increase the amount of time required to refine it again. Note that new panels unlocked are NOT automatically allocated. The 4th and 5th refineries deal with units and credits and are explained by clicking on them. 

### Goals & milestones
The last thing to note as a new player is the green checkmark. This opens a menu that displays goals and milestones that once achieved will provide various buffs. Note that you have to tap the completed goal to get the reward.
