Perk Discriptions

### Perks
⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ LUCK: Makes all chances better.
Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it has diminishing returns.

⭐⬛⬛⬛⬛ BURST: Can make crits add extra taps
It stinks. By the time you unlock BURST you are already doing 50+ TPS so an extra tap here or there doesn't make a difference.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CRIT RATE: How often taps crit
Haven't used.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CRIT MULTI:
How big a tap crit is - Haven't used.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ TPS:
Taps per second - Not sure if 1 level = 1 TPS? Good early game when you have low TPS.

⭐⭐⭐⬛⬛ MOD RARITY:
Increases mod level chance - Higher mods are good. Only problem is it requires ~100 levels of this to go up 1 rarity.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ U RARITY:
Increases Upgrade rarity - Even better then mod rarity. Still requires a lot of levels to go up one level.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CREDIT DROP:
More credits drop - Haven't used. But guessing it doesn't increase drops by that much... Plus late game when you need credits you mostly idle so this wouldn't help.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ DUP:
Duplicator makes mods dup. It's ok.

⭐⬛⬛⬛⬛ MERGE CHARGE:
When you merge, the next mod spawns faster - If your really active early game then it can give you something to do. Late game you auto merge and this doesn't do anything.

⭐⭐⭐⬛⬛ TIER MERGE:
Chance to go up more levels when mods merge - Haven't used. If it increases the chance to merge higher by a lot then could be 4 or 5 stars.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EQUIP TIER:
Makes equipment have a higher tier - THIS IS THE BEST. Makes all equips have higher boosts. I had around 20 levels total and it made my equips all boost by 1E27

⭐⭐⭐⭐⬛ E RARITY:
Increases equipment rarity - Really good, but like all other rarities takes tons to make a difference...

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ U LEVEL:
Increases Upgrade level - Don't know if this still spawns. I think 1 perk level = 1 upgrade level. Can make upgrades high level.

⭐⭐⬛⬛⬛ CHEST RARITY:
Increases chest rarity - Chest rarity is broken right now so is actually bad. If chests were not broken would still be the worst rarity perk.
