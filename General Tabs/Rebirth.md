# Rebirth
The higher you push in a run before rebirthing, the more units you get.
These units individually each provide a 1*% global profit boost and also can be spent permanently for new abilities.
So striking a balance between purchasing new abilities and keeping enough units for your global buff is crucial.

\* the 1% is multiplied by your unit boost
