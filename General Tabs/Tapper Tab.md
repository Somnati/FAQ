# Tapper Page
The main screen. This is where you will tap for profit and collect chests. 
As you continue to tap, you will see a multiplier that will grow. 
Initially this only affects your tap profit but can later affect other features. 
Occasionally, you will see critical hits that provide bonus currency. 
This will build your basic currency. 
On this screen you will see pop-ups that include daily gifts, random chests, your taps per second (at the bottom) and a minimized version of your panels.

### Goals & milestones
The last thing to note as a new player is the green checkmark. This opens a menu that displays goals and milestones that once achieved will provide various buffs. Note that you have to tap the completed goal to get the reward.
