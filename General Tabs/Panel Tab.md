# Panels
To the right of the main screen. 
It has two parts. An info page and a buy page.
Certain milestones do things like increase speed or provide substantially more currency for that panel. 
At the bottom of this screen you can upgrade the amount of currency you gain per tap. 
Automation of these panels comes semi-randomly in the form of abilities, for which you will see a pop-up.
At the top of this screen there is a button to toggle information between "per cycle" and "per second".
This allows you to have a better understanding of what each panel is doing.
