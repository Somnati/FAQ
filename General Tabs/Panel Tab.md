# Panels
Swiping left will bring you to the panels screen. 
On this screen you can click on your panels to have them run. 
Each panel earns an upgradeable amount of currency per iteration. 
Swiping left again will allow you to upgrade these panels. 
Certain milestones do things like increase speed or provide substantially more currency for that panel. 
At the bottom of this screen you can upgrade the amount of currency you gain per tap. 
Automation of these panels comes semi-randomly in the form of abilities, for which you will see a pop-up.
At the top of this screen there is a button to toggle information between "per cycle" and "per second" to allow you to have a better understanding of what each panel is doing.
