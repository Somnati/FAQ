# Ability Deck
On the ability deck page you can spend your pool of AP to mix and match the abilities you would like to use. 
At the top of this page you have the option to purchase new equippable abilities using units. 
Units are a 3rd currency gained thru rebirthing. 
The higher you push in a run before rebirthing, the more units you get. 
These units individually each provide a 1% global profit boost and also can be spent permanently for new abilities, so striking a balance between purchasing new abilities and keeping enough units for your global buff is crucial. 
As you purchase more copies of the same abilities, they are recorded as XP, and once enough is gained you can spend units to permanently increase that ability.
