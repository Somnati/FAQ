# Upgrades
To the left of the main screen are upgrades. 
These upgrades range from new abilities that you have to equip to base panel upgrades and more. 
Upgrades are purchased with credits, which are a separate currency. 
Some abilities must be equipped from the ability deck in the hamburger menu at the top right of the screen. 
Others (such as panel speed, panel growth etc) are automatically applied when you purchase them on this screen.
